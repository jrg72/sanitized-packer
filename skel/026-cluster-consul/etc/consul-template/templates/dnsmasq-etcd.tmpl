    @todo doesn't this belong in 027-cluster-etcd?
    
    Workaround for broken consul large DNS replies.  Produces an SRV record in
    the service.consul. domain that is equivalent to what Consul itself would
    return.
    
    https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/v2.1.1/Documentation/clustering.md
    _<service>._<protocol>.service[.datacenter][.domain]
    so <service> needs to be etcd-server
    buuuuut, it doesn't work when the targets in the SRV response are large

    (these times 3):
      _etcd-server._tcp.service.consul. 0 IN SRV 1 1 2379 ip-172-31-1-214.us-west-1.aws.hack1.bsdinternal.com.node.us-west-1_aws_hack1.consul.

    etcd errors with
      discovery: discovery: error querying DNS SRV records for _etcd-server lookup _etcd-server._tcp.service.consul. on 127.0.0.1:53: cannot unmarshal DNS message

    lots of finger-pointing, no resolutionâ€¦
